The animation is quite straight forward to use:

1. Select the event ID you are interested in watching in the dropdown.
2. Choose whether to filter by the auxiliary flag.
2. Hit play!
3. The chart is interactive so you can pivot the camera, zoom in, etc. *but only when the animation is not playing*. 
4. To help understand the data the top interactions based on the size of the charge observed are displayed in a table, along with the sensor coordinates that recorded the interaction.
